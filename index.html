            <h1>story of Virat </h1>
            <p>There’s a very good reason Virat Kohli is referred to as the ‘King’. The Indian captain’s batting record is hardly matched by any other cricketer on the planet, with his aggressive approach to the game also making him a player fans flock to watch. <br>
                Kohli always dreamed of representing his country in cricket and had his first opportunity as a teenager when he played for the India under-19 team in 2006, guiding the same team to a World Cup win in 2008. <br>
                His senior international career took off soon after when Kohli made his one-day international debut against Sri Lanka in August 2008. He now has more than 35 one-day hundreds and many other fine performances to his name, with a high-score of 183 against Pakistan in 2012. He averages more than 50 in 50-over cricket. <br>
                Kohli has been equally as impressive in the five-day game. He averages over 50 and has made 17 centuries and 14 fifties in 59 Tests. As of January 2019, he was the #1 ranked batsman in the world in both the ODI and Test formats.
                Kohli’s brilliance with the bat is matched by his skills as a captain in all three forms of the game. While a major tournament win still eludes the Indian’s under his leadership, the side has regularly held the #1 world ranking in both Test and ODI cricket. He has the greatest Test Match winning percentage as an Indian captain, with a most recent triumph being a 2-1 series victory against Australia – the first ever Indian series win on Australian soil.</p>

            <h1>Virat Kohli's IPL career </h1>
            <p>Virat Kohli's IPL career has been very successful. He has played for the Royal Challengers Bangalore since the inception of the Indian Premier League in 2008. Kohli started as a young and promising batsman and over the years, he has established himself as one of the best in the world.<br><br>
                In the IPL, Kohli has scored a total of 6,613 runs in 199 matches, with an impressive average of 38.16 and a strike rate of 130.41. He has also scored 5 centuries and 41 half-centuries in the tournament. In the 2016 season, he broke the record for the most runs scored by a batsman in a single IPL season, amassing 973 runs in 16 matches. <br><br>
                Kohli has been the captain of the Royal Challengers Bangalore since 2013 and has led the team to the playoffs on multiple occasions. However, he is yet to win an IPL title with the team. Nonetheless, his performances in the tournament have been outstanding, making him one of the most valuable players in the league. <br></p>
